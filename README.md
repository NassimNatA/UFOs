# UFOs

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to modify a webpage design to be more user-friendly with additional filter options for UFO data (specifically: date, city, state, country, shape). This is accomplished by utilizing JavaScript to create a table to organize UFO data (in array or list format). Ultimately, this will make the websie more dynamic for users with an functional, interactive dashboard.
